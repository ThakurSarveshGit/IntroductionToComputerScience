## 1. Operator Precedence

Understanding operator precedence is crucial in programming as it determines the order in which operations are evaluated in an expression. Let's delve deeper into this topic.

### Explanation:

Python follows the PEMDAS rule to determine operator precedence:

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents `**`
3. Multiplication and Division `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` (evaluated left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction `+`, `-` (evaluated left to right)

Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. If operators have the same precedence, they are evaluated from left to right.

### Example:

Consider the expression: `2 + 3 * 4 / 2`

To evaluate this expression correctly, we follow the operator precedence:

1. `3 * 4` equals `12`
2. `12 / 2` equals `6`
3. `2 + 6` equals `8`

So, the result of `2 + 3 * 4 / 2` is `8`.

### Multiple Choice Question:

What is the result of `5 * 3 + 2 ** 2 - 9 / 3`?

a) 5 \
b) 10 \
c) 17 \
d) 16 (Correct)

Explanation: Following operator precedence, first, `2 ** 2` is evaluated which results in `4`. Then `9 / 3` is evaluated as `3`. After that, multiplication and division are performed from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction. Hence, the result is `16`.

### Practice Problems:

1. Evaluate the expression: `(10 - 2) * 5 / 3 + 8`
    21.33
2. Write a Python function that takes an arithmetic expression as input and returns the result after evaluating it according to operator precedence.

## 2. Python Basics Review

Before diving into more advanced concepts, let's review some fundamental aspects of Python programming.

### Explanation:

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some key basics:

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Variables are used to store data. Python supports various data types including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

2. **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif` allow you to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions.

3. **Loops**: Loops such as `while` and `for` enable you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

4. **Functions**: Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in modularizing your code and making it more organized.

### Examples:

```python
# Variables and Data Types
x = 5  # integer
y = 3.14  # float
name = "Alice"  # string
is_student = True  # boolean

# Conditional Statements
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")

# Loops
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Functions
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet("Bob")
```

### Multiple Choice Question:

What will be the output of the following code snippet?

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```

a) x is greater than 5 (Correct) \
b) x is equal to 5 \
c) x is less than 5 \
d) Nothing will be printed

Explanation: Since the value of `x` is `10`, the condition `x > 5` is `True`, and the corresponding print statement is executed.

### Practice Problems:

1. Write a Python program to find the largest among three numbers entered by the user.
2. Implement a function called `is_prime` that takes an integer as input and returns `True` if it's a prime number, otherwise `False`.

Feel free to tackle the practice problems and ask for solutions or further explanation!


## 3. Conditional Statements (if/else/elif)

Conditional statements are fundamental constructs in programming that allow you to control the flow of your code based on certain conditions. In Python, `if`, `else`, and `elif` are used for this purpose. These statements enable your program to make decisions dynamically, executing different blocks of code depending on whether specific conditions are met or not.

### Detailed Instructions:

1. **if Statement**: The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `True`. If the condition is `False`, the block of code inside the `if` statement is skipped.

   ```python
   x = 10
   if x > 5:
       print("x is greater than 5")
   ```

   In this example, the print statement will be executed because the condition `x > 5` is `True`.

2. **else Statement**: The `else` statement follows an `if` statement and executes a block of code if the `if` condition is `False`.

   ```python
   x = 3
   if x > 5:
       print("x is greater than 5")
   else:
       print("x is not greater than 5")
   ```

   Since `x` is `3` (which is not greater than `5`), the `else` block will be executed, printing "x is not greater than 5".

3. **elif Statement**: The `elif` statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It stands for "else if" and is used when you have more than two possible outcomes. You can have multiple `elif` statements after an `if` statement.

   ```python
   x = 5
   if x > 5:
       print("x is greater than 5")
   elif x == 5:
       print("x is equal to 5")
   else:
       print("x is less than 5")
   ```

   In this case, since `x` is equal to `5`, the `elif` block will be executed, printing "x is equal to 5".

### Explanation:

Conditional statements are crucial for controlling the flow of your program. They allow your code to make decisions dynamically based on the values of variables or other conditions. By using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements, you can create complex decision-making structures that make your programs more flexible and powerful.

### Example:

Let's consider a scenario where we want to determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero:

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
elif num == 0:
    print("The number is zero")
else:
    print("The number is negative")
```

This code prompts the user to enter a number and then checks if it's positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.

### Practice Problem:

Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it's even or odd using conditional statements.

### Additional Note:

Conditional statements are powerful tools for controlling the flow of your program. They allow you to write code that can adapt to different situations, making your programs more robust and versatile. Mastering conditional statements is essential for becoming proficient in programming.


## 4. Loops (While / For)

Let's dive into loops, covering both the `while` and `for` loops, with clear explanations and practical examples.

### Explanation:

Loops are essential constructs in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They help in automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. In Python, there are two main types of loops: `while` and `for`.

1. **While Loop**: The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. It continues iterating until the condition becomes `False`.

2. **For Loop**: The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes the block of code for each element in the sequence.

### Detailed Instructions:

1. **While Loop**:
   - In a `while` loop, the condition is checked before executing the block of code. If the condition is `True`, the block of code is executed, and then the condition is checked again. This process continues until the condition becomes `False`.

   ```python
   i = 1
   while i <= 5:
       print(i)
       i += 1
   ```

   In this example, the loop prints the numbers from 1 to 5.

2. **For Loop**:
   - A `for` loop iterates over a sequence of items. It goes through each item in the sequence and executes the block of code for each item.

   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```

   This loop prints each fruit in the list `fruits`.

### Example:

Let's consider a scenario where we want to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 using both `while` and `for` loops:

```python
# Using while loop
total = 0
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    total += i
    i += 1
print("Sum using while loop:", total)

# Using for loop
total = 0
for num in range(1, 11):
    total += num
print("Sum using for loop:", total)
```

Here are more examples showcasing a variety of `for` loops in Python:

1. **Looping Over a String**:

```python
# Iterate over each character in a string
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
```

This loop will print each character of the string "Python" on a separate line.

2. **Looping Over a List of Tuples**:

```python
# List of tuples
coordinates = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]

# Iterate over each tuple in the list
for point in coordinates:
    x, y = point  # Unpacking the tuple
    print("X coordinate:", x, "Y coordinate:", y)
```

This loop unpacks each tuple into `x` and `y` coordinates and prints them.

3. **Looping Over a Dictionary**:

```python
# Dictionary of student names and their corresponding grades
grades = {'Alice': 85, 'Bob': 90, 'Charlie': 75}

# Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary
for name, grade in grades.items():
    print(name, 'got a grade of', grade)
```

This loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `grades` and prints the student's name along with their grade.

4. **Looping Over a Range with Step**:

```python
# Print numbers from 0 to 10 with a step of 2
for i in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(i)
```

This loop prints numbers from 0 to 10 with a step of 2, resulting in output: `0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10`.

5. **Nested Loops**:

```python
# Nested loop to generate a multiplication table
for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 5):
        print(i * j, end="\t")  # Use tab to separate columns
    print()  # Move to the next row after inner loop completes
```

This nested loop generates a multiplication table from 1 to 4.

These examples demonstrate the versatility and power of `for` loops in Python, allowing iteration over various data structures and ranges. By utilizing `for` loops effectively, programmers can streamline their code and automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

### Practice Problems:

1. Write a Python program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `while` loop.
2. Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using a `for` loop.

### Additional Note:

Loops are powerful tools for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. They allow you to write more concise and efficient code. Understanding how to use `while` and `for` loops effectively is essential for becoming proficient in programming.
